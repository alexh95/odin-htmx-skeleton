# TODO

Source of truth for outstanding work. Check items off as you finish them; add follow-ups you
discover. See `CLAUDE.md` for the standing policy. Keep this and `CHANGELOG.md` current.

## Now / next

- [~] **Vision + flagship + style library** (this initiative). Anchored by
      [`PHILOSOPHY.md`](PHILOSOPHY.md), [`docs/USE_CASES.md`](docs/USE_CASES.md),
      [`docs/DATA.md`](docs/DATA.md). Keep app/e2e/load-tests **at par** at every phase.
  - [x] **Phase A — direction docs.** PHILOSOPHY (vision), USE_CASES (sweet spot + flagship
        direction), DATA (datasource future-proofing). Wired into README/CLAUDE.
  - [x] **Phase B — theming foundation.** `data-style` × `data-scheme` on `<html>` (SSR default
        `modern`/`midnight`, restored pre-paint from localStorage); token contract; stateless
        `<details>` picker in the topbar (vanilla JS apply/persist, no endpoint → load par).
        **Modern** is the reference style with four schemes (Midnight/Daylight/Nebula/Aurora).
        e2e: picker switch + persist. Build clean, 32/32 e2e.
  - [x] **Phase C — the styles.** All five shipped — Skeuomorphic, Terminal/CRT, Brutalist,
        Editorial/Paper, Arcade (video-game) — each a pure `[data-style]` block with multiple
        schemes, every style incl. a light option. Plus cache-busting (`?v=hash`) so style edits
        show without a hard refresh. Library: 6 styles, 23 schemes.
    - [x] Turned `/components` into a live style/scheme **showroom**: a catalog of all 6 styles ×
          23 schemes at the top of the page; click any swatch to jump to that exact style+scheme and
          the whole page (components below) re-skins live. e2e covers it; no new server surface.
  - [~] **Phase D — flagship app.** Evolve the sampler into one cohesive internal admin console.
        Each new endpoint gets e2e **and** load scenarios in the same change.
    - [x] **Contact detail drilldown** — click a row's name → `GET /contacts/:id` opens a drawer
          with the full record, a derived **activity trail**, and **related** contacts (same role,
          each a one-click jump). Read-only for now. e2e + `detail.js` load scenario added.
    - [x] Inline edit + actions in the detail drawer (edit fields, cycle, delete — all swapped in
          place; edits OOB-refresh the table row; `repo_update` persists score). e2e + load at par.
          Phase-D review fix: an invalid drawer edit now surfaces an OOB error toast instead of
          silently reverting.
      - Known limitation: an in-drawer edit/cycle OOB-refreshes the row *in place*, so a
        filtered/sorted table can briefly show a row that no longer matches until the next
        interaction. A deeper fix would thread the table's q/status/sort into the drawer and
        re-render the whole region; acceptable for the POC.
    - [~] Richer table.
      - [x] Saved/quick **status filters** (chips: All/Active/Invited/Disabled; compose with search +
            sort + paginate via a threaded `status` arg).
      - [ ] Bulk actions (select rows → set status / delete) — deferred.
    - [~] Coherent product frame. Done: dashboard stat cards drill into the filtered/sorted data
          view (overview → tool). Further (deferred): a named console identity + deeper nav IA.
  - [x] **Phase E — parity + polish sweep.** Parity closed: Phase D endpoints all have e2e + load
        (detail.js, the create→edit→delete write path, the new **list.js** for `GET /contacts`
        filter/sort); CHANGELOG/docs current; the Phase D review fix landed. Also wrote the
        **Odin data-layer implementation plan** ([`docs/DATA_IMPL.md`](docs/DATA_IMPL.md)).
        Phase E review pass swept the whole Phase D+E surface and caught a reflected
        HTML-injection via the `sort` query param (unescaped reflection into the table's `hx-get`
        attributes) — fixed by `url_encode`ing `sort` everywhere, pinned by an e2e regression test.
- [x] **Data layer — persistent SQLite** (replaces the in-memory POC).
  - [x] Implemented per [`docs/DATA_IMPL.md`](docs/DATA_IMPL.md): amalgamation binding
        (`src/sqlite/`), the seven `repo_*` over SQLite, `prepare.*` fetch+compile (pinned + SHA-256),
        `DB_PATH` (`:memory:` default / file persists), WAL + migrations + `schema_version`. Contract
        unchanged; e2e + load pass untouched. apollo-11 persists to a named volume; Fly stays
        `:memory:` pending a volume (documented in `fly.toml`).
  - [x] **Repository cleanup + split.** Split into a **common** part (`repo.odin` — connection
        lifecycle incl. `repo_close`, the migration runner, the shared `exec`/`prep`/`bind`/`clone`/
        `scalar` helpers + the lock) and **per-entity** files (`contacts.odin`, `events.odin`), each
        owning its statements + procs. Helpers grouped, error handling documented (fatal at boot,
        best-effort per request), `repo_close` wired via `defer` in main.
  - [x] **Multi-table case — events between contacts.** `events(actor_id, target_id → contacts,
        ON DELETE CASCADE, kind, at, note)` (`migrations/0002_events.sql`). The detail drawer's
        activity feed is now **real**: `event_timeline` JOINs back to contacts to resolve the other
        party, each a one-click jump (replaces the faked `service_activity`). Deleting a contact
        cascades its interactions. End-to-end at par: model + repo + service + view + e2e (incl. a
        cascade test; **42 e2e**) + load (`detail.js` now exercises the JOIN). Load re-measured:
        reads scale ~3–4× under the single-connection exclusive lock (`detail` JOIN worst at 1.9×) —
        see `load-tests/RESULTS.md`.
  - [ ] **Per-thread WAL connections** (next, load-justified) — restore concurrent reads; re-measure.
- [~] **Set up infrastructure** per [`infra/PLAN.md`](infra/PLAN.md). Code + config landed;
      what's left are operator actions on Fly/GitHub/Cloudflare (no repo changes).
  - [x] Prereq code change: `app/main.odin` reads `PORT` and binds `0.0.0.0` on `BIND_ALL`
        (loopback stays the local default).
  - [x] Pin odin-http as a submodule (`app/odin-http` @ `112c49b`) for reproducible builds.
  - [x] `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` + `fly.toml`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (build,
        smoke, deploy-on-`master`).
  - [ ] Operator: create the Fly app + set the `FLY_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret, then push to
        trigger the first deploy (see `infra/PLAN.md` → "Operator steps").
  - [x] Operator: front the Fly app with a **proxied Cloudflare record** (`fly certs add` + the
        `_fly-ownership` TXT and `_acme-challenge` CNAME for DNS-01 validation, CF SSL Full-strict).
        This was also a latency fix: Fly's IPv6 anycast mis-routed an EU ISP to the `jnb`
        (Johannesburg) edge (~785 ms TTFB) while IPv4 hit `ams` (~160 ms); routing through
        Cloudflare's edge bypasses Fly's anycast and serves both v4/v6 in **~105 ms** with
        `/static` edge-cached. The Fly region was also moved `iad`→`fra` so the origin is nearby.
  - [ ] Stand up the dedicated load-test environment when load-tests are implemented.
- [x] Implement the e2e suite per [`e2e/PLAN.md`](e2e/PLAN.md) — Playwright, 31 tests incl. the
      three regressions; wired into CI as a gating job. It surfaced (and we fixed) the `fmt`
      brace bug in the page `<head>` and the OOB-toast wrapper.
- [x] Implement the load-tests per [`load-tests/PLAN.md`](load-tests/PLAN.md) — k6 scenarios
      (static/pages/search/api/write/mixed), a `run.sh`/`run.bat` sweep driver, and
      `RESULTS.md`. Single-thread baseline captured.
  - [x] Headline follow-up: guarded the store with an `sync.RW_Mutex` and set `thread_count`
        to the core count (`THREADS` env overrides). Before/after in `RESULTS.md`: reads scale
        **~5×** (1→8 threads), writes ~1.8× (exclusive-lock-bound, as predicted), and the
        500-VU overload failures (13–34%) drop to **0%**. Also ran it against prod (Fly).
  - [x] Two-host absolute numbers: deployed to the apollo-11 home server
        ([`deploy/apollo-11`](deploy/apollo-11)), k6 on the workstation over a 1 GbE LAN. Found the
        wire ceiling (static/pages saturate ~912 Mbit vs 2.4 GB/s loopback) and the reverse-proxy
        cost (~12× for NPM+TLS on the shared box). Surfaced the io_uring-vs-Docker-seccomp gotcha.
        Results in `RESULTS.md`. (Further: a generator *outside* the LAN for the true external path.)
- [~] **Sync gate:** every endpoint now has both an e2e and a load scenario for its *class*
      (static, page, search, api, write). `/healthz` is hit by the run driver's readiness
      probe rather than a dedicated scenario; add one if it ever does real work.

## Backlog

- [ ] Data table: the actions column overflows into horizontal scroll on narrow viewports.
      Consider a responsive tweak (narrower engagement column, or stacked actions).
- [ ] Pin htmx to an exact version in `prepare.*` (currently `@2`) for reproducible builds.
- [ ] Optional: a build-flag-gated `/__reset` endpoint to reseed the store (useful for load
      tests; must never ship in a normal build). Tie to `load-tests/PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Optional: `-o:speed` build path for benchmarking vs. the default showcase build.

## Done

- [x] Initial showcase app (dashboard, components, forms, data + CRUD, search, JSON API).
- [x] Bug fixes: modal outside-click, `/forms` field reset, static slider fill.
- [x] Restructure into `app/` + `e2e/` + `load-tests/`; project docs (`CLAUDE.md`, this file,
      `CHANGELOG.md`).
- [x] git init + first commit; adopted Conventional Commits; infrastructure plan
      (`infra/PLAN.md`).
