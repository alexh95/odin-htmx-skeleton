# TODO

Source of truth for outstanding work. Check items off as you finish them; add follow-ups you
discover. See `CLAUDE.md` for the standing policy. Keep this and `CHANGELOG.md` current.

## Now / next

- [~] **Set up infrastructure** per [`infra/PLAN.md`](infra/PLAN.md). Code + config landed;
      what's left are operator actions on Fly/GitHub/Cloudflare (no repo changes).
  - [x] Prereq code change: `app/main.odin` reads `PORT` and binds `0.0.0.0` on `BIND_ALL`
        (loopback stays the local default).
  - [x] Pin odin-http as a submodule (`app/odin-http` @ `112c49b`) for reproducible builds.
  - [x] `Dockerfile` + `.dockerignore` + `fly.toml`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (build,
        smoke, deploy-on-`master`).
  - [ ] Operator: create the Fly app + set the `FLY_API_TOKEN` GitHub secret, then push to
        trigger the first deploy (see `infra/PLAN.md` → "Operator steps").
  - [ ] Operator: point a Cloudflare domain at the Fly app (`fly certs add` + DNS).
  - [ ] Stand up the dedicated load-test environment when load-tests are implemented.
- [x] Implement the e2e suite per [`e2e/PLAN.md`](e2e/PLAN.md) — Playwright, 31 tests incl. the
      three regressions; wired into CI as a gating job. It surfaced (and we fixed) the `fmt`
      brace bug in the page `<head>` and the OOB-toast wrapper.
- [x] Implement the load-tests per [`load-tests/PLAN.md`](load-tests/PLAN.md) — k6 scenarios
      (static/pages/search/api/write/mixed), a `run.sh`/`run.bat` sweep driver, and
      `RESULTS.md`. Single-thread baseline captured.
  - [ ] Headline follow-up: guard the store with a lock, set `thread_count = N`, and re-run
        the read-heavy scenarios for the before/after scaling curve (`load-tests/PLAN.md` →
        "What we expect to learn"). This is the one open piece of the load-test plan.
- [~] **Sync gate:** every endpoint now has both an e2e and a load scenario for its *class*
      (static, page, search, api, write). `/healthz` is hit by the run driver's readiness
      probe rather than a dedicated scenario; add one if it ever does real work.

## Backlog

- [ ] Data table: the actions column overflows into horizontal scroll on narrow viewports.
      Consider a responsive tweak (narrower engagement column, or stacked actions).
- [ ] Pin htmx to an exact version in `prepare.*` (currently `@2`) for reproducible builds.
- [ ] Optional: a build-flag-gated `/__reset` endpoint to reseed the store (useful for load
      tests; must never ship in a normal build). Tie to `load-tests/PLAN.md`.
- [ ] Optional: `-o:speed` build path for benchmarking vs. the default showcase build.

## Done

- [x] Initial showcase app (dashboard, components, forms, data + CRUD, search, JSON API).
- [x] Bug fixes: modal outside-click, `/forms` field reset, static slider fill.
- [x] Restructure into `app/` + `e2e/` + `load-tests/`; project docs (`CLAUDE.md`, this file,
      `CHANGELOG.md`).
- [x] git init + first commit; adopted Conventional Commits; infrastructure plan
      (`infra/PLAN.md`).
