# bot

The house assistant (PLAN §14.3, D31; Q20, Q32), on its mock at M2. Packages: `bot` (the domain: questions of at most
4,000 runes, titles, what a backend is asked, the answer's markdown render), `models` (D31's backend contract:
`Bot_Request`, `Bot_Event`, `Bot_Done` with llama's stats shape, `Bot_Health`, `Bot_Sink`; conversations, turns and the
store contract), `backend_mock` (the default and, until M7's llama binding, the only backend), `views` and `web` (the
routes, the backend switch, both deliveries, Stop and the limits). Its store at M2: memory (`app/stores/memory/bot/`);
SQLite joins at M7.

**An answer** is a stream on the asker's own connection, in four frames: the question and the answer's shell with Stop;
the answer's text into `#mb-<mid>` a piece at a time (an SSE answer adds `event: hx:release` after the first, so the
form is back while it streams); the answer rendered as markdown with its stats, in place of the shell (`outerMorph`);
the end. The form chooses the delivery: an SSE answer to its POST, or a multipart one, which also sends `#usage` and,
for a conversation's first question, `#conv-title`. `x-impl: bot.backend=<name>` says which backend answered.

**The mock** runs a timer chain on the stream's loop: canned "under construction" and "TODO" lines, word by word,
30–120 ms apart (`BOT_DELAY_MS` fixes it, 0 as fast as the loop goes), coalesced to at most 20 events a second, and the
same answer for the same question when `BOT_SEED` is set. `cancel`, from Stop on any loop or a browser that went away,
is posted to the generation's loop, which removes its timer and sends `Bot_Done{.Stopped}`.

**Who may ask** (Q20, §17.5): members keep their conversations (the newest 50, each with its last 200 turns), ask one
at a time and `BOT_MEMBER_PER_HOUR` (30) an hour; guests get the mock, `BOT_GUEST_PER_HOUR` (5) an hour per client,
and nothing is kept. A conversation is its owner's alone: anyone else's id answers 404.

It owns `/bot`, its own prefix.
