package audit_models

// ---- audit: the types and the store contract ---------------------------------------------
//
// PLAN §17.7, §6.2 (3). `store:audit` is the one store any domain, web or identity package may
// import: an append-only log has no rules for a domain to add. The SQLite family keeps
// `audit_log` (append-only by triggers; a row may go only past 400 days), the memory family
// writes one `mod=audit` log line and lists nothing. Times are unix ms. Never a message body
// or a password: an entry names who did what to which, and why.
