//
// Below the domain, the views and both stores (PLAN §5.1, §14.2). A notification is
// a producer's fragment for one member: `kind` is the producer's namespaced name
// ("chat.mention"), `ref` what it points at (a room's URL), `html` its line, already
// escaped by the producer, which builds it from its own fixed markup.
