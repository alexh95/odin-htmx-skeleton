// ---- the query pool (D16) ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// Two threads for anything that scans, ranks, exports, backs up or can hit a
// budget: an inline 4 ms scan cut a loop's fast path from 51.4k to 11.5k rps; on
// the pool it stayed at 51-52k (12 §4). Each worker reads on its own connection,
// as a loop does. The caller defers its response (F-13) and answers in the task's
// `done`; a full queue answers 503.
