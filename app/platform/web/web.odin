package web

// ---- platform/web: routes, requests and responses (L3) ----------------------
//
// The one platform package that imports odin-http (the fork, app/vendor). It
// re-exports the request and response types, so every handler is written over
// ^web.Request and ^web.Response and no feature imports odin-http. It holds the
// route row (D5), the per-host prefix router (§8.3), the responses with their
// charset, the embedded assets, the platform's own routes, and the request
// context `front` (platform/app) fills before a handler runs.
