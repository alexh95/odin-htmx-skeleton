# platform/markdown

Markdown, a safe subset: domains render at write time and store the HTML. Everything is escaped through
`platform/escape`, raw HTML shows as text, links go only to http(s), mailto or this site, images only from the
prefix the caller names. A pure zone (D15 rule 7): no lock, no I/O, no SQLite. Layer L2 (PLAN §5.1).
