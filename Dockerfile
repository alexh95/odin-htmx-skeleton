# Three stages: build one profile's self-contained binary (PROFILE, skeleton by
# default), list the runtime base's Debian packages, then ship the binary alone as
# /app/bin on distroless (PLAN §20.2). Every static asset is embedded in it, so the
# runtime image carries no toolchain, no shell and no asset files.
#
# Running it needs Linux io_uring, which Docker's default seccomp profile blocks
# (since 25.0): start it with docker/seccomp-io-uring.json, as compose.yaml does,
# or the server aborts at startup. containerd's default (since 2.0) blocks it too,
# so on Kubernetes RuntimeDefault isn't enough: load the same profile (Localhost).

# Debian 13 (trixie) on both sides, so the glibc the binary links against is the
# glibc it runs on. Pinned by digest; a bump moves both lines together.
