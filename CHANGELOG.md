[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project is pre-1.0 and dates are used in
place of releases. **Every behaviour/structure/build change gets an entry under
`[Unreleased]`** — see `CLAUDE.md`. Entries track [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
`feat`→Added, `fix`→Fixed, `refactor`/`perf`/`style`→Changed, removals→Removed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initialized the repository as git and made the first commit.
- Adopted Conventional Commits; documented the spec and changelog mapping in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Infrastructure plan ([`infra/PLAN.md`](infra/PLAN.md)): remote hosting, CI/CD, deployment,
  and where to run e2e / load-tests — free / low-cost.
- Deployment: `Dockerfile` (two-stage, pinned Odin `dev-2026-06`, single-binary + static
  runtime), `fly.toml` (Fly.io, always-on `shared-cpu-1x`), and `.dockerignore`.
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — build with `-warnings-as-errors`, smoke-test the binary
  (pages, static, JSON API, CRUD), and deploy to Fly.io on green `master`.
- `app/main.odin` reads `PORT` from the environment and binds `0.0.0.0` when `BIND_ALL` is
  set, so the binary is container-deployable (local default stays loopback).
- `GET /healthz` liveness probe (200 `ok`); wired as the Fly.io health check in `fly.toml`.
- End-to-end test suite ([`e2e/`](e2e/)): Playwright over a freshly built binary — navigation,
  search, components, forms, CRUD and assets, including the three regression bugs. Runs across
  all three engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). Wired into CI as a gating job; deploy now needs
  both `build` and `e2e`.
- `compose.yaml` for an optional local prod-parity run (`docker compose up --build`) — builds
  the same image Fly deploys. Not required for dev; handy for load-tests against a prod-like
  container.
- Favicon (`app/static/favicon.svg`, linked from the page head): a fusion mark — htmx's `</>`
  brackets on the project's violet→cyan gradient tile with the app's bolt accent.
- SEO: a **page-specific `<meta name="description">`** (the item Lighthouse flagged) plus Open
  Graph `og:type`/`og:title`/`og:description` on every page, threaded through `render_page`.

### Changed
- Refactored the backend into one Odin **package per layer** under `app/src/`
  (`models`, `repository`, `services`, `views`, `controllers`, and `src/` = entry `main`+routes),
  so the layering is compiler-enforced rather than convention. Cross-layer calls are now
  qualified (`repository.repo_list`, `views.view_dashboard`, …). Build entry is `odin build src`;
  `htmx.min.js` is `#load`ed from `controllers`. Behaviour unchanged (93/93 e2e green).
- Vendored odin-http as a pinned git submodule (`app/odin-http`, commit `112c49b`) for
  reproducible CI/CD builds; `prepare.*` stays the local-dev convenience path.
- e2e now runs **fully in parallel**: each Playwright worker spawns its own server on its own
  port with an isolated in-memory store (`global-setup.ts` builds once, `fixtures.ts` spawns
  per worker), replacing the single shared server + `workers: 1`. ~2.5× faster locally. On CI
  the engines are **sharded across concurrent runners** (a browser matrix) instead of piling
  workers onto one CPU-bound runner, and each shard runs in **Playwright's official Docker
  image** (which also ships node/npm) so the browsers + OS deps are preinstalled (no per-run
  install — that was the biggest, most variable cost). `workers` tracks the runner's cores.

### Performance
- First page load: `defer` the embedded htmx script so it no longer blocks rendering (the
  pre-paint theme script stays synchronous to avoid a flash). htmx still initialises before
  `DOMContentLoaded`; the full e2e suite passes unchanged across all three engines.

### Fixed
- Linux/CI build: `prepare.*` now creates `bin/` (odin's `-out:` won't), the shell scripts
  carry the exec bit, and the Dockerfile/CI invoke `prepare` via `sh` — so the build no
  longer depends on a pre-existing `bin/` or the exec bit surviving a Windows-origin context.
- Page `<head>` was emitting `%!(MISSING)`: Odin's `fmt` treats `{`/`}` as directives, so the
  `htmx-config` JSON and the theme pre-paint script were mangled (htmx ran on defaults and
  threw on `JSON.parse`). The cycle button's `hx-vals` JSON had the same break. Brace-bearing
  literals now bypass `fmt` (written with `w()`). Caught by the new e2e suite.
- Out-of-band toasts (form submit, contact create) now keep their `.toast` wrapper — htmx's
  positional OOB swap appends an element's children, so the toast is wrapped in a carrier.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- Project docs for efficient single-prompt sessions: `CLAUDE.md` (architecture, code/CSS/JS
  aesthetics, odin-http API cheat sheet, allocator model, Odin/HTMX gotchas, recipes), this
  `CHANGELOG.md`, and `TODO.md`.
- Test plans: `e2e/PLAN.md` (Playwright browser tests) and `load-tests/PLAN.md` (k6/bombardier
  throughput tests). Plans only — not yet implemented.
- Top-level `README.md` describing the `app/` + `e2e/` + `load-tests/` layout.

### Changed
- Restructured the repo: the entire application moved into `app/`, with `e2e/` and
  `load-tests/` as siblings. Run/prepare scripts are location-independent (`%~dp0` /
  `dirname`), so they work unchanged from `app/`.

### Fixed
- Invite dialog no longer closes on an outside (backdrop) click, so a half-typed field can't
  be lost by accident. Dismissal is explicit (× / Cancel).
- `/forms` no longer clears the name and email fields when the email validates. The email
  field's `htmx:afterRequest` was bubbling to the form and triggering `reset()`; the handler
  is now guarded with `event.target === this`.
- Range sliders now paint their fill to match the thumb as it moves (was a static 60%). The
  fill is driven by a `--fill` custom property updated from `app.js`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- Initial Odin + HTMX showcase.
  - Pure-Odin backend on `odin-http` (server, router, request/response over `core:nbio`);
    HTMX embedded into the binary via `#load` and served from memory; CSS/JS from disk.
  - Layered backend: models → repository → services → controllers → views.
  - Pages: Dashboard, Components gallery, Forms (with live inline validation), Data & CRUD.
  - Global debounced HTMX active-search plus a plain JSON API (`/api/search`).
  - In-memory CRUD over POST/DELETE; single-threaded lock-free store.
  - Hand-written, token-driven CSS with a dark/light theme toggle and snappy animations.
  - Cross-platform `prepare`/`run` scripts (Windows / Linux / macOS).
